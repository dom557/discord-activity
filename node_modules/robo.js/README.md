## Epic Simplicity

Robo.js dishes out Discord.js goodness with a focus on simplicity, making it easy-peasy to craft bots that truly sparkle â€“ all without compromises! ðŸŒŸ

- **Easy-peasy:** No fuss, just a smooth start to bot development, so you can focus on crafting cool features.
- **Built-in awesomeness:** Commands, events, plugins - it's all there, ready to create bots that pack a punch.
- **Sage's helping hand:** Sage simplifies command interaction and offers smart error replies, making debugging a breeze.
- **Customizable & scalable:** Adjust, grow, and adapt your bot as needed with Robo.js's flexibility.
- **Community power:** Tap into the know-how and support of the Discord.js community.

## Usage

Crafting a simple Robo is a piece of cake! First, whip up a `/ping` command by creating a `ping.js` file in your `/src/commands` folder:

```javascript
export default () => {
	return 'Pong!'
}
```

Miss your interaction object? No worries, it's still got your back! Here's another example using `interaction.reply`:

```javascript
export default (interaction) => {
	interaction.reply('Pong!')
}
```

For events, say you want to listen to `messageCreate` events. Create a `messageCreate.js` file inside your `/src/events` folder:

```javascript
export default (message) => {
	if (message.content.includes('hello')) {
		message.channel.send('Hello there!')
	}
}
```

Following the above examples, your file structure should look a lil' something like this:

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ commands/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ping.js
â””â”€â”€ events/
    â””â”€â”€ messageCreate.js
```

Before you get your Robo rockin', update your `.env` with `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`. Then, hit `robo dev` and let the show begin! Seriously, that's it!

### No Learning Curve

Get ready for a twist - **there's virtually no learning curve with Robo.js!**

Wait, is it actually an... inverse learning curve? You heard right, there's more to unlearn than learn! It's that simple, yet you still have access to all that Discord.js has to offer, just easier and with less code. ðŸŽ‰
